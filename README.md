- React with Redux for managing state.
- Redux sagas to handle complex behavior like WebSockets.
- Server using Websockets for communication.
- Both Dev and Production builds.
- Styleguide configured (via React-Styleguidist).
- Pixel-perfect testing configured using phantomcss (targets React-Styleguidist generated html, to find the components there and make screenshots for comparison).
- Cleaned-up from unnecessary dependencies.
